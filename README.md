Hey. I'm Oliver. I'm from the UK. I'm a 13-year-old self-taught programmer, who is fluent in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white&style=flat-square) and currently learning ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-239120?logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white&style=flat-square). I love coding and hate school.
